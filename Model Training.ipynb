Kind regards,  Adrianne EnglerHuman Resourcesx57302  \",4],[\"GentlemenI wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco\\'s headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco\\'s customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald\\\\/E-speed.All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F\\\\/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical. Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.RegardsJohn Cummings\",0],[\"Good morning my SLED.

We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn\\'t a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn\\'t know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn\\'t know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn\\'t confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven\\'t talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).

This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).

The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped =out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser=ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=ine, but said he couldn\\'t supply any further details.=20Houston-based Enron is the nation\\'s biggest energy trader and a principal i=n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=ts finances remain sound.=20Confidence in Enron\\'s financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=drew Fastow.=20Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20Enron\\'s stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=dard & Poor\\'s said he believes that Enron was \\\\\"getting a bit more resistanc=e\\\\\" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=g, he said.=20The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and= still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing= Enron\\'s debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=r rating could hamper Enron\\'s core trading businesses.=20Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =week could impair \\\\\"Enron\\'s financial flexibility and access to capital mark=ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business.\\\\\"=20The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company\\'s trading partners are =doing business with Enron on \\\\\"essentially the same terms\\\\\" as they have in t=he past. \\\\\"There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,\\\\\" h=e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant\\'s f=inances.=20The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase= & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to= show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. \\\\\"Confid=ence in this company was lost,\\\\\" said one bank official involved in the nego=tiations for a new credit line. \\\\\"But confidence will be restored.\\\\\"=20Corporations of Enron\\'s size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.= Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=strates the pressure Enron is feeling.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Manager\\'s Journal: How Enron Ran Out of GasBy Paul Kedrosky10\\\\/29\\\\/2001The Wall Street JournalA22(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=, Enron\\'s shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of= which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for= the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=\\'s revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=elling stakes in energy producers.=20The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=nd 55 times earnings. That\\'s more like Cisco\\'s once tropospheric valuation =than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke= Energy.=20But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a \\\\\"new economy\\\\\" Web-ba=sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=y\\'s stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=rice then.=20Then the new economy motor stalled. The company\\'s president left under stra=nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron\\'s machinations in Califor=nia\\'s energy markets. Investors pored over Enron\\'s weakening financial stat=ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic= scholars to penetrate the company\\'s cryptic financials. In effect, Enron\\'s= troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or= how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that= they really didn\\'t know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20Not that Enron didn\\'t make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how= -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20Enron\\'s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=. According to Enron\\'s March 2000 10-K, a \\\\\"senior officer of Enron is the m=anaging member\\\\\" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron \\\\\"ma=nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars.\\\\\" It was=, in a phrase, Enron\\'s house hedge fund.=20There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market= -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =when the Enron executive was the company\\'s CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=n done.=20As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow\\'s LJM partnershi=p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM\\'s wrong-foo=ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow\\\\/LJM and the co=mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=.=20We didn\\'t do anything wrong is Mr. Lay\\'s refrain in the company\\'s current r=ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=parency.=20Where has Enron\\'s board of directors been through all of this? What kind of= oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =It is time Enron\\'s board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house= -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20---=20Mr. Kedrosky is a professor of business at the University of British Colomb=ia.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to =convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a c=ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or =do business with it.Enron\\'s board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t=wo weeks to monitor the company\\'s financial situation, held another meeting= this afternoon. \\'\\'The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac=tions when appropriate,\\'\\' an Enron spokesman said.=20Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced= by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it=s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last wee=k. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and =it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i=nquiry into its financial accounting.=20Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucia=l to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. La=tely, Enron\\'s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and t=wo major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the co=mpany\\'s rating.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights ReservedCOMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders\\' equity. A hastily=-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =as it answered about these \\\\\"related-party transactions\\\\\". The departure of A=ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed= it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20\\\\\"This marks the end of Enron\\'s walk on the wild side,\\\\\" observes Curt Launer=, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor= relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron\\'s growth in the 1990s appear to= have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle \\\\\"new economy\\\\\" magic o=n to old economy companies.=20Enron\\'s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey= Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =develop energy trading.=20For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=ing it.=20The two sides of the business - trading and generation\\\\/supply - have always= been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more= likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling\\'s answer =in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A= management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=, director, manager and associate\\\\/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling\\'s early recruits recalled: \\\\\"It was =all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules.\\\\\"=20The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a \\\\\"loose-tight\\\\\" management m=odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in= existing markets.=20Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=e behind Enron Online, the group\\'s internet-based trading platform, changed= jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation\\\\/remuneration. Mr =Skilling once described the approach in this way: \\\\\"As long as you clear you=r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=nt around here.\\\\\"=20This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world=\\'s leading e-commerce company.=20It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=t service provider.=20In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive= of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine\\'s list of the 500 most power=ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =America and Boeing.=20In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he= abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=ation.=20A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to= avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron\\'s accounts. Other =financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =and Azurix. \\\\\"They went after too many things too quickly,\\\\\" says Stephen Moo=re of Moody\\'s Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=y. The group\\'s extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=o which it is exposed.=20David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=nvestors during last week\\'s conference call. He told the group\\'s management=: \\\\\"The company\\'s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =questionable.\\\\\"=20The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. \\\\\"The problems, in our view, =stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=lls,\\\\\" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. \\\\\"Power plants =in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=nergy business.\\\\\"=20Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=ading volumes failed to materialise.=20\\\\\"They over-promised on the new business they created,\\\\\" says Chris Bartlett,= a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=y. \\\\\"Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price.\\\\\"=20Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =of realisable value within the group\\'s portfolio of physical energy assets.==20And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=agement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team =will have to tighten up.=20(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. Moody\\'s also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron\\'s commercial paper. Enron\\'s credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners\\' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company\\'s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. Investors have fled Enron\\'s stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. Many industry observers see Enron\\'s request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. \\\\\"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one\\'s backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it\\'s an act of desperation,\\\\\" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit\",0],[\" \",1],[\"John,Here are the deals that the LNG group are currently working on.

Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.  It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:1.  Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)2.  Seasonal quotes (winter \\'03, summer \\'04, etc.)In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.Also, I am aware that our current position doesn\\'t give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.
